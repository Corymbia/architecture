= Organization =
----
The organization of the repository reflects the long-lived nature of a features true specification.  That is, the specification and design work related to a feature's implementation for a particular release often corresponds with only a portion of the entire feature's implementation.  Moreover, feature's specification evolves over time as the requirements, architecture, and upstream specifications evolve.

The following table describes the organization of the top-level of the repository.

{| style="width=90%"
|+ '''Top-level Directory Structure'''
| <code>features/</code>
| this is where '''all''' content goes
|-
| <code>bin/</code>, <code>lib/</code>
| ''Ignore these. '' Contain helpers and their libraries
|-
| <code>releases/</code>
| ''Ignore these. '' Contain auto-generated xref of features to releases
|}

== Feature Directory ==
Each feature is contained in its own directory.  The organization of the <code>features/${feature}</code> directory, for some imagined <code>${feature}</code>, is described in the following table:

{| style="width=90%"
|+ '''Feature Directory Structure''' (e.g., <code>features/${feature}/</code>)
| <code>/overview.wiki</code>
| colspan="2" | Top-level document aggregating all the sub documents
|-
| <code>/xref</code>
| colspan="2" | xref's to the JIRA epic(s) and confluence pages
|-
| <code>/spec.wiki</code>
| colspan="2" | High level architecture document
|-
| <code>/diagrams</code>
| colspan="2" | Source materials for diagrams and their generated documents (images)
|- 
| <code>/X.Y</code> 
| Documents specific to the work done (or going on during) the X.Y release. 
| For example <code>features/${feature}/3.3/</code> contains documents for the 3.3 release.
|-
|
| <code>/overview.wiki</code>
| Overview document aggregating all the release specific feature information
|-
|
| <code>/spec.wiki</code>
| Release specific feature specification
|-
|
| <code>/design</code>
| Release specific design documents
|-
|
| <code>/xref</code> 
| xref's to the JIRA epic for the current release
