<code>***********************************************************************
code: EERRUR
when: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MMMZ 
who: eucalyptus 
what: ntpd is not running
why: cause unknown
where: the one you installed

== "running instance failed because libvirt has hung" example ==
<code>***********************************************************************
code: EERRUR 
when: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MMMZ 
who: account number & user id 
what: instance i-%8.8X failed to run
why: libvirt is hung
where: attempt to invoke SOMEOPERATION which timed out
how: SOMEOPERATION timed out
resolution: 
 1. stop libvirt
 2. start libvirt
 3. confirm 'virsh list' returns w/o error
 4. restart nc

- addressing side-effects:
- verification:
= Troubleshooting Requests =
- ntp issues
-- fault: ntpd is not running
-- fault: failed to accept message due to clock skew
- NC: libvirt issues when instances are being launched
-- fault: running instance failed because of error returned by libvirt
-- fault: running instance failed because libvirt has hung
- NC: issues around volume attachment/detachment
- Messaging errors in axis2c
- NC: libvirt errors/NC errors in case the instance terminated prematurely
- DNS setup
- system ran out of some resource
- traceability of resources (i.e., which CC did request go to, which NC did request go to)
- quite a few errors derives from images
-- having some way to keep track of a certain image boot success could be useful
-- been able to check that the emi booted successfully on all the NCs
-- been able to check that the emi booted successfully as all (some) users
-- it booted well on all NC but X and Y
-- it did booted but with a different kernel
-- image/NC size limits 
- eucalyptus.conf sanity checks
- vmware_conf sanity checks
- #2177: Option to euca_conf to automatically sync eucalyptus.conf
- #8726: euca_conf --initialize: check to make sure hostname is resolvable
- Registration: be more verbose than "RESPONSE true" or "RESPONSE false". how about: "Registration succeeded."
- host systems limitations (check and warn for disk size and provide other such hints).
- image/cluster/node/hypervisor compatibility
- handling of network mode/config changes
- NOTREADY state error reporting
- Log errors about SELinux/Apparmor related issues
- error information about attempted image boot (e.g., partition table, kernel info?)
- vmware image import validation
- VMFS datastore configuration validation, esp. w/ multiple datastores
- esxi node specific error information
  
= General Logging Requests =
- track i-123ABC
- IP and EBS operations with i-123ABC
- find errors associated with i-123ABC
- specific handling of user-facing faults (even in log files)
- per component logging
- per instance (resource) logging
- Installation / configuration / upgrade troubleshootiness 
-- generating install/config log

= Other Requests =
- #592: CONFIG: separate config files for front-end and nodes
- #339: CONFIG: registration "wizard"
- admin can act on any resource
-- should already be the case -- when is it not?
- syslogd impl.
