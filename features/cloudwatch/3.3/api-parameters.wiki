== ListMetrics ==

Description :
  - Returns a list of valid metrics stored for the AWS account owner. Returned metrics can be used with GetMetricStatistics to obtain statistical data for a given metric.
  - Note: Up to 500 results are returned for any one call. To retrieve further results, use returned NextToken values with subsequent ListMetrics operations.
  - Note: If you create a metric with the PutMetricData action, allow up to fifteen minutes for the metric to appear in calls to the ListMetrics action. Statistics about the metric, however, are available sooner using GetMetricStatistics.

== PutMetricData ==

Request Parameters :
Will Support :

Description
  - Publishes metric data points, which are associated specified metric. If the specified metric does not exist, it is created.

  - The size of a request is limited to 8 KB for HTTP GET requests and 40 KB for HTTP POST requests.
  - Important: Although the Value parameter accepts numbers of type Double, Amazon CloudWatch truncates values with very large exponents. Values with base-10 exponents greater than 126 (1 x 10^126) are truncated. Likewise, values with base-10 exponents less than -130 (1 x 10^-130) are also truncated.
