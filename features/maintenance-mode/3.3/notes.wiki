* Support for vmware 5.0 and 5.1
* There is a clear overhead to setting up the environment for vmware setup
* Are there conditions under which evacuation can fail?
** What is the behaviour in the resource exhaustion case?
*** Defragging?  Over-committing?
* What are the expected performance characteristics?
* Planned hardware migration is the fundamental use case
* Failure feedback:
** Immediate -- it is possible to, i will reserve resources for, and then perform migration
** Batched/Eventual -- keep trying to do migration until it succeeds
* Administrator can quarantine resources for future when current usage levels prevent immediate evacuation
* Choosing the destination node is not a part of the MVP for 3.3
* Vast majority not using shared storage
** Trending towards commodity storage
* Best practice? Reserved resources for the purposes of supporting migration
** Would require support for marking resources as reserved
* Three scenarios
** Resources available
** Resource over-committing needed
*** Additional over-commiting factors to support maintenance emergencies?
** Resources not available
* Least common denominator masking for CPU types
* What do we have to do wrt w/ concurrency
** Handle only one operation at a time in 3.3
* Support for multiple network interfaces
