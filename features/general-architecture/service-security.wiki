This is a collection of high-level security guidelines to follow when implementing a new service or intergrating an external component with Eucalyptus.

== Eucalyptus Services ==
* Should require authentication and authorization for all operations/resources that are not intended to be public
* Stand-alone services should have a separate set of component keys
* Should not have permissions to write into its own config files
* Should not run with root privileges
* Should protect its data from unauthorized access (in database and on the filesystem)
* Should treat third-party credentials/secrets with extra caution and never store/log/transmit them in unencrypted form 
* Should verify authenticity, integrity, and timestamps of received messages
* Should follow other general security [[security.wiki|guidelines]] as applicable

== Front-end Services ==
* Should follow all of the above requirement for a Eucalyptus service
* Should integrate with IAM and have support for IAM policies (all operations and resources) unless explicitly not required
* Should have SSL support for all endpoints
* Should allow for installation of CA-signed SSL certificates for all endpoints

== Third-party/External Services Integration ==
* Do not allow external services direct access to any internal data (credentials, database, files, etc.)
* Use a dedicated set of credentials for authentication and communications with external services
