This is a collection of high-level security guidelines to follow when implementing a new service or intergrating an external component with Eucalyptus.

== Eucalyptus Services ==
* Should require authentication and authorization for all operations/resources
* Each service that uses cryptorgraphy should have a separate set of component keys
* Should not have permissions to write into its own config files
* Should not run with root privileges
* Should protect its data from unauthorized access (in database and on the filesystem)
** Access to data should be restricted to implementing service
** Any sensitive data should be encrypted with the service's keys
* Should never store/log/transmit third-party credentials/secrets in unencrypted form  
* Should verify authenticity, integrity, and timestamps of received messages
* Should have SSL support for all endpoints
* Should follow other general security [[security.wiki|guidelines]] as applicable

== Front-end Services ==
* Should follow all of the above requirement for a Eucalyptus service
* Should integrate with IAM and have support for IAM policies (all operations and resources) 
** ARN support is required if AWS service supports ARNs ([[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html|ARNs]], [[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_SpecificProducts.html|IAM Support by AWS Services]])
* Should support AWS Signature Version 4
* Should allow for installation of CA-signed SSL certificates for all public endpoints

== Third-party/External Services Integration ==
* Do not allow external services direct access to any internal data (credentials, database, files, etc.)
* Use a dedicated set of credentials for authentication and communications with external services
