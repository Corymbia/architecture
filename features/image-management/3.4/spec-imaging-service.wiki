= Instance Import/Export API =
The '''Imaging''' service is:
* The engine for driving image conversion/import tasks.  
* Is the ground-truth for conversion task state
* Will have to be queried for information needed to fulfill '''EC2 Instance Import/Export Service''' requests.
This service has several parts:

== Service Design ==
[[image-management-3.4-image-service.png|float|width=2000px|align=right|frame]]
* '''EC2 Instance Import/Export service''': User facing service implementing AWS/EC2 specified operations.
* '''Imaging service''': Internal-only service which manages all conversion tasks (not only the import/export requests).

== EC2 Instance Import/Export Service ==
This service is part of the EC2 API implementation and performs a portion of the work of processing requests:
* Accepts user requests
* Validates the parameters
* Sends the request to the '''imaging''' service
* Responds to the user.  
* Subsequently, the user can poll the state of the import task.
Import/Conversion task state is stored in the persistence subsystem (DB) and is managed by the '''Imaging''' service.

== Import/Export Operations ==
These are the user-facing service operations defined by AWS as part of the Instance Import/Export services:
{|
|+ See [[image-management-3.4-spec-import-service-api|Instance Import/Export Service API]] and [[image-management-3.4-spec-import-service-api|Imaging Service API]]
|-
! Name !! Description
|-
! '[[#ImportInstance|ImportInstance]] || [[EC2 ImportInstance|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-ImportInstance.html]] This is the new operation corresponding to the user-facing EC2 ImportInstance operation.  The important distinction here is that the runtime validations are performed and the instance is subsequently made available to the user.  This operation is a composition of the below primitives.
|-
! '[[#ImportVolume|ImportVolume]] || [[EC2 ImportVolume|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-ImportVolume.html]] This is the new operation corresponding to the user-facing EC2 ImportVolume operation.  The important distinction here is that the runtime validations are performed and the volume is subsequently made available to the user.  This operation is a composition of the below primitives.
|-
! '[[#DescribeConversionTasks|DescribeConversionTasks]] || [[EC2 DescribeConversionTasks|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-DescribeConversionTasks.html]] This operation lists the status of currently ongoing import tasks (any of the above kinds need to be queryable in this fashion)
|-
! '[[#CancelConversionTask|CancelConversionTask]] || [[EC2 CancelConversionTask|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-CancelConversionTask.html]] This operation cancels an extent conversion task
|-
| ''CreateInstanceExportTask'' || [[EC2 CreateInstanceExportTask|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-CreateInstanceExportTask.html]]
|-
| ''CancelExportTask'' || [[EC2 CancelExportTask|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-CancelExportTask.html]]
|-
| ''DescribeExportTasks'' || [[EC2 DescribeExportTasks|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-DescribeExportTasks.html]]
|}
The backend implementation for the '''bolded''' operations are required for 3.4 while those that are ''italicized'' are out of scope for 3.4.  

== Internal Import/Export Operations ==
These operations are to serve as the internal complement for the user-facing operations defined above for the '''EC2 Instance Import/Export service'''.
{|
! Name !! Description
|-
! '[[#ImportImage|ImportImage]] || Internal service operation which takes a manifest URL reference and creates an internally bundled, converted, validated image in an (optionally provided) output bucket.
|-
! '[[#ImportImage|ImportVolume]] || Internal service operation which takes a manifest URL reference and creates an internally bundled, converted, validated image in a volume.
|-
! '[[#ValidateInstance|ValidateInstance]] || runs a collection of image validation checks which are performed on a ''running instance'', again, using the '''image toolkit'''.
|-
! '[[#DescribeImagingTasks|DescribeImagingTasks]] || This is an internal service operation which corresponds with the internal import image workflow supporting bundling of instances.
|-
! '[[#CancelImagingTask|CancelImagingTask]] || Cancels the imaging task indicated by the supplied identifier
