= Image Management =
The way machine images are handled will receive attention in following areas:
# **Disk-images**:  Support for direct boot of disk based machine images (i.e., kernel and ramdisk are embedded)
# **CreateImage/BundleInstance**:  Creation of images from currently running instances; both linux & windows and instance-store & ebs.
# **Image Toolkit**:  Library of tools implementing image validation, conversion, and test.
# **Instance Import**:  Enabling services which validate, convert, and test images using the image toolkit.
# **Image Import CLIs**:  Client tools which orchestrate the validation, conversion, and test just like the above service, but usable from the command line.
# **Instance Import Tools**:  Client tools which, using the above, enable the import of instances from AWS and VMware.
# **NOTE**: The converse ''export'' functionality is not within scope as the AWS import services are limited to windows.

- VM image import: 
-- is it using S3?
-- validation: metadata (e.g., vsphere) and raw disk validations
-- ability to pass parameters across the import interfaces
-- component, activity, and information breakdown
-- client, service, image toolkit, validations, verifications, and conversions diagrams
- test cases for canonical image format change
-- boot {disk,partition,disk w/ kernel & ramdisk} {linux, windows} {ebs, instance-store}
