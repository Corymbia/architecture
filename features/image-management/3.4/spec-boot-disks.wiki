= Booting Disk Images =
This feature consists of supporting booting directly from a full-disk image which has a bootloader setup in the MBR and, so, subsequently boots using an image internal kernel/ramdisk configuration (in the case of linux).

== KVM ==
Requires changes to the way that instances are started up.  There are no known technical obstacles.

== VMware ==
This is already the case.

== Xen ''(out-of-scope)'' ==
Currently Xen is not part of the supported/tested hypervisor sets.  However, with the return of Xen4 in CentOS 5.4 it may become a consideration.  Support for Xen would come in the form of pv-grub.
