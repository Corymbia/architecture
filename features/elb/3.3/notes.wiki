  - software f5; software big ip
  - impl details related to zone coverage
    - e.g., zone goes down elb can cross zones to continue service
  - identification of things we need (to change) in existing APIs 
    - list needed to consider scheduling
  - versions of protocols we support HTTP,HTTPS,TLSv?,SSLv?
  - types of session management wrt load balancing 
    - affinities, stickinesses,
    - ssl termination (at lb?)
  - ipv6 - out of scope? guessing yes.
  - initially a eucalyptus component
    - software reference implementation
    - support for hardware future requirement
  - configuration, esp. compared to what can be configured in AWS (e.g., http connections time outs)
  - candidates for reference software implementation
    - ha proxy
    - nginx
    - glassfish plugin: probably doesn't work for us
    - squid
    - linux virtual server
    - momentum si?
  - future hardware support expected:
    - big ip f5
  - preconfigured load balancing rules

=== Questions ===
  - what is the functional spec/use cases 
    - implications on deployment (e.g., backup power, network hardware/topology)
  - survey of customer load balancing use cases, infrastructure?
  - hybrid use case/story? importance?
  - tightly coupled with autoscaling? is that use case central?
  - use cases are satisfied by elb?
    - is there any case which is not satisfiable by ELB?
