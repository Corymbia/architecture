Probably need to package this since we would need the [tcp proxy module](https://github.com/yaoweibin/nginx_tcp_proxy_module.git),
which requires that we patch nginx.

* GeoIP
* gd (graphics library)
* libxslt
* openssl

= Distributing a VM  =

== Methods of Distribution ==

* Provide tools for creating the LB image
** Includes kickstart file and tool (e.g. ami-creator)
** We should provide these if we supply a VM or not
* Provide a pre-built VM with LB
** How are these obtained?

== When to build the VM ==

* When packages are built
** Builds take longer
*** Using remote mirror (20mins)
*** Using local mirror (5mins)
** Requires us to provide new VMs when security patches are needed
** Requires us to have a method of distribution for images
* When packages are installed
** Can allow users to get updated dependencies themselves
** Creates a longer installation process
** Requires documentation of the image build process
