== Private Keys and Certificates ==
* Key length: 1024, 2048-bit and 4096-bit encryption.
* Keys, Certificates, and Trust Chain must in PEM format.
* Certificates must follow the X.509 PEM format.
* The current date must be between the certificateâ€™s start and end date.
* Public and private certificate files must contain only a single certificate.
* The private key must match the public key that is in the digital server certificate.
* The private key must be an RSA private key in PEM format, where the PEM header is BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY and the footer is END RSA PRIVATE KEY (as shown in Sample Certificates).
* The private key cannot be encrypted with a password.
* A certificate chain starts with the immediate signing certificate and is then followed by any intermediaries in order. Intermediaries that are not involved in the trust path must not be included. The trusted root certificate can be optionally included as the last certificate.
