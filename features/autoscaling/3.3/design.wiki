= Overview =
This design covers our implementation of AWS Auto Scaling.

== Tracking ==

{|
! Status || Draft || 
|-
! Updated || 2012/12/19 || Initial document, focus is preparation for Sprint 1
|}

== Out of Scope ==
Properties related to functional areas that we do not suport are out of scope. These areas are:

* IAM Roles
* Placement groups
* Spot Instances
* SNS
* VPC

== Feature Dependencies ==
* ELB - health check type
* Tagging - propagation of tags to instances

== Related Features ==
This feature relates to the following features in this release:

* Tagging / Filtering
* CloudWatch
* ElasticLoadBalancing

== Implementation Summary ==

= Analysis =
== Open Issues ==
* Are we implementing metrics operations? ( DescribeMetricCollectionTypes, DisableMetricsCollection, EnableMetricsCollection )
* Are we supporting CW of auto scaling?
* Are we supporting "pagination" for describe operations?
* Should we enforce default account quotas?

= Design =

== Entities ==

The following entities will be added:

* Launch configuration
* Auto scaling group
* Auto scaling instance (join table from group to instance? or just add info to existing instance)

== Service Impact ==
A new Query API user facing service is added.

=== Integration Areas ===

! Item !! Value !! Notes 
|-
| Vendor || autoscaling || Prefix for actions, e.g. autoscaling:DescribeLaunchConfigurations
|-
| Resources || launchconfiguration ||
|-
| &nbsp; || autoscalinggroup ||
|-
| &nbsp; || tag ||
|-
| Actions || autoscaling:* || We will permit use of any actions from the supported API version
|-
| Quotas || autoscaling:quota-launchconfigurationnumber ||
|-
| &nbsp; || autoscaling:quota-groupnumber ||

The ARN of an Auto Scaling resource has the form:

  arn:aws:autoscaling::<account id>:<resource type>/<resource id>


== Eucalyptus Extensions ==
=== IAM ===
Support for quotas and resource (see above)

=== Administrative Functionality ===
We will extend the standard functionality for administrative purposes.

The following operations will support listing of all accounts/users item:

* DescribeLaunchConfigurations
* DescribeAutoScalingGroups
* DescribeTags

The following operations will support deletion of items belonging to other accounts/users:

* DeleteLaunchConfiguration
* DeleteAutoScalingGroup
* DeleteTags
