= Overview =
This design covers our implementation of AWS Auto Scaling.

== Tracking ==

{|
! Status || Draft || 
|-
! Updated || 2012/12/19 || Initial document, focus is preparation for Sprint 1
|-
! Updated || 2013/01/28 || Updated for Sprint 2 functionality (which was previously for Sprint 1)
|-
! Updated || 2013/02/01 || Updated with Sprint 2 final details
|}

== Out of Scope ==
Implementation of items related to features that we do not support are out of scope. These features are:

* IAM Roles
* Placement groups
* Spot Instances
* SNS
* VPC

== Feature Dependencies ==
* EC2 - Verifying metadata, managing instances, tagging
* ELB - health check type

== Related Features ==
This feature relates to the following features in this release:

* EC2 - Tagging / Filtering
* EC2 - Instance health checking
* CloudWatch
* ElasticLoadBalancing

= Analysis =
== Open Issues ==
* Are we implementing metrics operations? ( DescribeMetricCollectionTypes, DisableMetricsCollection, EnableMetricsCollection )
* Are we supporting CW of auto scaling?
* Are we supporting "pagination" for describe operations?
* Where are ARNs supported instead of names? (are ARNs supported for the policy name in PutScalingPolicy?)

= Design =

== Entities ==

The following entities will be added:

* Launch configuration
* Auto scaling group
* Auto scaling policy

== Service Impact ==
New SOAP / Query API user facing services are added.

=== Supported Operations ===

For more information on administrative support by operation, see Administrative Functionality below.

=== Integration Areas ===
==== IAM ====

{|
! Item !! Value !! Notes 
|-
| Vendor || autoscaling || Prefix for actions, e.g. autoscaling:DescribeLaunchConfigurations
|-
| Resources || launchconfiguration ||
|-
| &nbsp; || autoscalinggroup ||
|-
| &nbsp; || scalingpolicy ||
|-
| Actions || autoscaling:* || We will permit use in policy of any actions from the supported API version
|-
| Quotas || autoscaling:quota-launchconfigurationnumber ||
|-
| &nbsp; || autoscaling:quota-autoscalinggroupnumber ||
|-
| &nbsp; || autoscaling:quota-scalingpolicynumber ||
|}

The ARN of an Auto Scaling resource has the form:

  arn:aws:autoscaling::<account id>:<resource type>/<resource id>:[<name>/<value>]+

An example policy for service access:

    {
       "Statement":[{
          "Effect":"Allow",
          "Action":"autoscaling:*",
          "Resource":"*"
       }]
    }

== Eucalyptus Extensions ==
=== IAM ===
Support for quotas and resource (see above)

An example policy for limiting auto scaling groups:

    {
      "Statement":[{
        "Effect":"Limit",
        "Action":"autoscaling:createautoscalinggroup",
        "Resource":"*",
        "Condition":{
          "NumericLessThanEquals":{
            "autoscaling:quota-autoscalinggroupnumber":"2",
          }
        }
      }]
    }

=== Administrative Functionality ===
We will extend the standard functionality for administrative purposes.

==== Listing Resources ====
The following operations will support listing of all accounts/users item:

* DescribeLaunchConfigurations
* DescribeAutoScalingGroups
* DescribePolicies

To enable this the parameter '''verbose''' is passed as a ''name'' selector.

==== Deleting Resources ====
The following operations will support administrative deletion of resources:

* DeleteLaunchConfiguration
* DeleteAutoScalingGroup
* DeletePolicy

For administrative deletion the ARN of the resource must be used (not the simple name), e.g.:

  arn:aws:autoscaling::013765657871:launchConfiguration:6789b01a-a9c9-489f-9d24-ed39533fca61:launchConfigurationName/Test

==== Updating Resources ====
The following operations will support administrative update of resources:

* ExecutePolicy
* SetDesiredCapacity
* UpdateAutoScalingGroup

For administrative deletion the ARN of the resource must be used (not the simple name)

= Configuration =
No configuration properties noted.

= Upgrade =
No upgrade impact noted.

= Packaging =
No specific packaging requirements.

= Documentation =
Administrative functionality should be documented.

= Security =
Use of ARN in place of simple name adds risk of permitting deletion of other accounts resources.

= Testing =
No specific test cases noted.
