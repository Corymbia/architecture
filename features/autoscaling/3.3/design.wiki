= Overview =
This design covers our implementation of AWS Auto Scaling.

== Tracking ==

{|
! Status || Draft || 
|-
! Updated || 2012/12/19 || Initial document, focus is preparation for Sprint 1
|-
! Updated || 2013/01/28 || Updated for Sprint 2 functionality (which was previously for Sprint 1)
|}

== Out of Scope ==
Properties related to functional areas that we do not suport are out of scope. These areas are:

* IAM Roles
* Placement groups
* Spot Instances
* SNS
* VPC

== Feature Dependencies ==
* ELB - health check type
* Tagging - propagation of tags to instances

== Related Features ==
This feature relates to the following features in this release:

* Tagging / Filtering
* CloudWatch
* ElasticLoadBalancing

= Analysis =
== Open Issues ==
* Are we implementing metrics operations? ( DescribeMetricCollectionTypes, DisableMetricsCollection, EnableMetricsCollection )
* Are we supporting CW of auto scaling?
* Are we supporting "pagination" for describe operations?
* Where are ARNs supported instead of names?

= Design =

== Entities ==

The following entities will be added:

* Launch configuration
* Auto scaling group
* Auto scaling instance

== Service Impact ==
New SOAP / Query API user facing services are added.

=== Integration Areas ===
==== IAM ====

{|
! Item !! Value !! Notes 
|-
| Vendor || autoscaling || Prefix for actions, e.g. autoscaling:DescribeLaunchConfigurations
|-
| Resources || launchconfiguration ||
|-
| &nbsp; || autoscalinggroup ||
|-
| &nbsp; || tag ||
|-
| Actions || autoscaling:* || We will permit use of any actions from the supported API version
|-
| Quotas || autoscaling:quota-launchconfigurationnumber ||
|-
| &nbsp; || autoscaling:quota-autoscalinggroupnumber ||
|-
| &nbsp; || autoscaling:quota-tagnumber ||
|}

The ARN of an Auto Scaling resource has the form:

  arn:aws:autoscaling::<account id>:<resource type>/<resource id>

An example policy for service access:

    {
       "Statement":[{
          "Effect":"Allow",
          "Action":"autoscaling:*",
          "Resource":"*"
       }]
    }

== Eucalyptus Extensions ==
=== IAM ===
Support for quotas and resource (see above)

An example policy for limiting auto scaling groups:

    {
      "Statement":[{
        "Effect":"Limit",
        "Action":"autoscaling:createautoscalinggroup",
        "Resource":"*",
        "Condition":{
          "NumericLessThanEquals":{
            "autoscaling:quota-autoscalinggroupnumber":"2",
          }
        }
      }]
    }

=== Administrative Functionality ===
We will extend the standard functionality for administrative purposes.

The following operations will support listing of all accounts/users item:

* DescribeLaunchConfigurations
* DescribeAutoScalingGroups

To enable this the parameter '''verbose''' is passed as a ''name'' selector.
