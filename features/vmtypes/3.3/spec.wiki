VM Type support in Eucalyptus has two disjoint aspects:

# AWS compatibility as determined by published VM type names (but not necessarily characteristics).
# Private cloud administrator control over vm type definitions.


== AWS compatibility ==
Currently (09/18/12) the [[http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/|vm type definitions used by AWS]] are:
{|
! Micro 
| t1.micro 
|-
! Standard 
| m1.small 
| m1.medium 
| m1.large 
| m1.xlarge 
|-
! High CPU 
| c1.medium 
| c1.xlarge 
|- 
! High Mem 
| m2.xlarge 
| m2.2xlarge 
| m2.4xlarge 
|- 
! Cluster Compute 
| cc1.4xlarge 
| cc2.8xlarge
|-
! High I/O 
| hi1.4xlarge 
|-
! GPU 
| cg1.4xlarge 
|}
