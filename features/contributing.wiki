Broadly, this repository should have version-able source materials except when not available (e.g., third party PDF documentation).

* '''Text''':  must be renderable through the github interface 
* '''Graphics''':  must be text-based so a compile step is not only acceptable, but required.  
* '''Binary files''': may be committed in the cases that:
*# A binary output format (e.g., images) is needed:  In this case, it has to be compilable from a text-based and versioned file.
*# A reference document or tool is included:  These belong in specific places noted below.
* '''Auto-generated''':  A number of files in this repo are automatically generated **DO NOT EDIT THEM DIRECTLY**
*# Any binary file is either auto-generated or 3rd-party.
*# ''Surely more of them go here...''
